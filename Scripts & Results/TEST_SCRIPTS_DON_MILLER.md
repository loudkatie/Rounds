# Don Miller Test Scripts - Post Lung Transplant Recovery

## Script 1: Day 3 Post-Transplant (Original)

**Setting:** ICU step-down unit, morning rounds

> "Good morning everyone, this is Don Miller, 58-year-old male, day 3 post bilateral lung transplant for IPF. Overnight he remained hemodynamically stable on room air, saturating at 96%. His chest tubes are putting out minimal serous drainage, about 50 cc's in the last 12 hours, so we're planning to pull those today.
>
> Labs this morning show creatinine stable at 1.2, tacrolimus level came back at 9.8 which is within our target range of 8 to 12 for the immediate post-op period. We'll continue current immunosuppression dosing. White count is trending down nicely at 11.2.
>
> Chest X-ray shows expected post-operative changes, small bilateral pleural effusions that are stable. No evidence of rejection or infection at this time. He's working well with PT, sat up in the chair for 2 hours yesterday.
>
> Plan for today: remove chest tubes, advance diet to regular, continue current immunosuppression, repeat chest X-ray after tube removal, and if all goes well, we'll look at transferring him to the step-down floor tomorrow. Any questions from the team?"

## Script 2: Day 5 Post-Transplant

**Setting:** Step-down floor, morning rounds

> "Morning rounds on Don Miller, now day 5 post bilateral lung transplant. He transferred to the floor yesterday without any issues. Currently on 2 liters nasal cannula, saturating 94 to 95%. 
>
> Overnight nursing reports he had some increased work of breathing around 3 AM but responded well to repositioning and incentive spirometry. Temperature was 99.8 at that time but came down with Tylenol.
>
> Labs: Creatinine has bumped up slightly to 1.4 from 1.2. We're watching this closely - could be tacrolimus related or early dehydration. Tac level is 10.2, still therapeutic. White count is 9.8, down from 11. Hemoglobin stable at 10.1.
>
> Bronchoscopy yesterday showed the anastomoses look healthy, no signs of dehiscence. BAL cultures are pending but gram stain was negative which is reassuring.
>
> He walked 200 feet with PT yesterday, which is great progress. Appetite is improving, he's eating about 60% of his meals.
>
> Plan: Continue current immunosuppression, recheck creatinine this afternoon and if it continues to trend up we may need to adjust tac dosing or get nephrology involved. Push oral fluids. Continue aggressive pulmonary toilet and ambulation. We want him walking 400 feet today. Pending cultures, but no antibiotics needed at this time. Family meeting scheduled for this afternoon to discuss discharge planning - likely looking at 3 to 4 more days if trajectory continues."

## Script 3: Day 8 Post-Transplant

**Setting:** Step-down floor, discharge planning rounds

> "This is Don Miller, day 8 post bilateral lung transplant, and we're here for discharge planning rounds. Overall he's made excellent progress.
>
> Respiratory status: He's been on room air for the past 36 hours, saturating 95 to 97% consistently. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Most recent chest X-ray shows near-complete resolution of the effusions.
>
> Renal function has stabilized - creatinine came down to 1.3 after we pushed fluids and made a small tac dose adjustment. Current tac level is 9.5, right in range. We've transitioned him to twice daily dosing which will be his outpatient regimen.
>
> His full immunosuppression regimen is tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone taper. He'll be on prophylactic Bactrim, valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis, and fluconazole for the first 3 months.
>
> Functionally he walked 800 feet yesterday with PT, climbed one flight of stairs without desaturation. He's eating well, having regular bowel movements, no nausea from the medications.
>
> For discharge tomorrow, we need to ensure: pharmacy has called in all medications, home health nursing is arranged for twice weekly visits, he has his pulse oximeter and knows to call if sats drop below 92, and follow-up is scheduled - I want to see him in transplant clinic in one week, and he'll need surveillance bronchoscopy at 4 weeks.
>
> Signs to watch for at home: fever over 100.4, increased shortness of breath, new cough, decreased oxygen levels, any signs of infection. Don, do you and your wife have any questions before we finalize the discharge plan?"

## Usage Notes

- Read naturally at conversational pace
- Pause briefly between sentences as a doctor would
- These scripts progressively show: ICU → Floor → Discharge
- Each contains medical details that GPT should flag as important
- Script 3 especially should generate follow-up questions about medication management and warning signs
