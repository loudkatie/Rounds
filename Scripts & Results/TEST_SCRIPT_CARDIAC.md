### DR. PATEL (Cardiothoracic Surgery Attending):

"Alright team, bed 7 is Mrs. Margaret Chen. 72-year-old female, post-op day 3 from four-vessel CABG — we bypassed the LAD, diagonal, OM1, and RCA using left internal mammary to the LAD and saphenous vein grafts for the rest.

She's doing remarkably well. Extubated on POD 1, off pressors since yesterday afternoon. Currently on telemetry showing normal sinus rhythm, rate in the 70s, no ectopy. Blood pressure this morning 128/76, which is right where we want her.

Chest tubes are still in place — the mediastinal tube put out 85 cc's overnight which is appropriate, should be ready to pull tomorrow if that continues. Her pleural tube had about 40 cc's of serous drainage.

Labs look good. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2, we're okay holding transfusion unless she drops below 8. Creatinine actually improved to 1.1 from 1.3 pre-op, so her kidneys tolerated the bypass well. Troponins trending down as expected post-operatively.

Echo yesterday showed preserved EF at 50-55%, no pericardial effusion, and the grafts appear patent on Doppler. We'll get a formal CTA before discharge to document graft patency.

Pain management — she's on scheduled Tylenol and Tramadol with IV Dilaudid for breakthrough. Used 2 milligrams overnight which is reasonable. Let's transition her to oral oxycodone today if she's tolerating PO well.

For cardiac rehab, PT worked with her yesterday — she sat at bedside and dangled. Goal today is chair to commode, maybe a few steps with the walker. We'll advance as tolerated.

Medications: continue aspirin 81 daily lifelong, starting Metoprolol 25 twice daily to keep heart rate controlled, Lisinopril 5 for blood pressure and cardiac remodeling. Statin was already on board pre-op. Colace for bowel regimen.

Biggest thing I want the family to understand — she's doing great. Day 3 is typically when people turn the corner. If everything stays stable, we're looking at transfer to step-down tomorrow, then home by day 6 or 7 with cardiac rehab follow-up.

I'll be back for evening rounds. Any acute changes, page me directly. Questions?"

**Key medical terms the AI should translate:**
- CABG x4 = Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (4 vessels)
- LAD = Left Anterior Descending artery (main heart artery)
- OM1 = First Obtuse Marginal (side branch)
- RCA = Right Coronary Artery
- LIMA = Left Internal Mammary Artery (best graft type)
- SVG = Saphenous Vein Graft (leg vein used for bypass)
- POD 3 = Post-operative day 3
- Extubated = Breathing tube removed
- Pressors = Medications to raise blood pressure
- Telemetry = Continuous heart monitoring
- Ectopy = Irregular heartbeats
- Mediastinal tube = Chest drain near heart
- Serous = Clear, watery fluid
- Troponins = Heart damage markers (expected high after surgery)
- EF = Ejection Fraction (heart pumping strength)
- Pericardial effusion = Fluid around heart
- CTA = CT Angiogram (scan to see blood vessels)
- PO = By mouth (per os)
- Dangled = Sitting on edge of bed with legs hanging
