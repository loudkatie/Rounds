### DR. MARTINEZ (Attending):

"Good morning team. Let's round on Mr. Miller in bed 4. Don Miller, 75-year-old male, post-op day 6 from bilateral sequential lung transplant for end-stage IPF. 

Overnight he remained hemodynamically stable on room air, which is excellent progress. His tacrolimus trough this morning came back at 9.8, which is within our therapeutic window of 8 to 12. We'll keep his current dose at 3 milligrams twice daily.

His creatinine bumped slightly to 1.6 from 1.4 yesterday. I'm not overly concerned yet but let's hold his vancomycin and trend the BMP. Could be early tacrolimus nephrotoxicity or just volume status.

Bronchoscopy yesterday showed A0 B0 on transbronchial biopsies - that means no acute cellular rejection, which is the news we wanted. BAL cultures are pending but gram stain was negative.

His chest x-ray this morning shows expected post-surgical changes with small bilateral pleural effusions, stable from yesterday. We'll continue incentive spirometry and chest PT.

Pain is well controlled on his current PCA settings. He's using about 15 milligrams of morphine equivalent over 24 hours.

Plan: Continue triple immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone. Start prednisone taper tomorrow, down to 20 milligrams daily. Check tacrolimus trough again in 48 hours. If creatinine continues trending up, we'll need nephrology consult.

PT cleared him for ambulation today so let's get him up and walking. Goal is 3 laps around the unit. If he tolerates that well and his labs look good tomorrow, we can start talking about transfer to the step-down unit maybe Thursday or Friday.

Any questions from the team? No? Alright, let's move to bed 5."

- POD 6 = Post-operative day 6
- Hemodynamically stable = Heart and blood pressure are steady
- Tacrolimus trough = Blood level of anti-rejection medication
- Creatinine = Kidney function marker
- BMP = Basic metabolic panel (blood test)
- A0 B0 = No rejection on biopsy scale
- BAL = Bronchoalveolar lavage (lung wash sample)
- Triple immunosuppression = Three anti-rejection medications
- PCA = Patient-controlled pain pump
- PT = Physical therapy
